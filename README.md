# Students-Social-Media-Addiction-Data-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
```
This project analyzes students' social media usage and addiction patterns using Python. The objective is to understand how daily usage, platforms, sleep, mental health, and academic performance are related, using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
This project demonstrates real-world data analysis skills expected from a Data Analyst.
```
## Tools & Libraries
```
Python
Pandas – data manipulation & EDA
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib – basic visualizations
Seaborn – statistical plots
Jupyter Notebook
```
## Analysis Performed
```
Data loading and inspection (head(), info(), columns)
Checking missing values
Statistical summary using df.describe()
Frequency analysis using value_counts()
Group-based analysis using groupby()
Relationship analysis between:Social media usage & addiction score, Sleep hours & mental health, Academic performance & addiction
```
## Visualizations
```
Bar plots (platform usage, academic impact)
Count plots (gender, addiction level)
Histograms (daily usage hours, addiction score)
Comparative plots using Seaborn
```
## Key Insights
```
Higher daily usage hours are associated with higher addiction scores
Reduced sleep hours often correlate with higher addiction
Social media addiction can negatively impact academic performance
Certain platforms show higher engagement among students
```
